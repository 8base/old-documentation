# Client Tools

8base provides a set of client libraries that simplify building front-end applications on top of 8base platform:

* [**SDK**](https://github.com/8base/sdk) comes with a set of libraries that simplify authentication, connecting to the API, client-side subscriptions, file uploads and more. SDK uses [ApolloClient](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) for GraphQL requests and state management. It uses [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for authentication.

* [**Boost UI Kit**](https://github.com/8base/boost) provides a set of common UI components, such as form fields, tables, layout elements and a file upload widget. Some of the components are pre-wired with the 8base API to enable automatic client-side validation and other features.

* [**Quickstart App**](../../getting-started/quick-start.md) can be used as a starter project to quickly learn how to build on 8base.

# Application File Uploads

For React developers 8base provides an open source `@8base/file-input` package that wraps Filestack picker and makes it easy to include file uploading in your application. The file picker comes with ability to upload files from user's computer, a URL, Google Drive, Facebook, Dropbox and other sources as well cropping and rotating images. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/c1329d2-filestack-picker.png](https://files.readme.io/c1329d2-filestack-picker.png)", "filestack-picker.png", 764, 515, "\#dfe0e0" \], "caption": "File picker" } \] } \[/block\] You can find React usage examples here:

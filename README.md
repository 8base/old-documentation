## Contributing to 8base Docs
Like most great things, 8base is a work in progress. As a consequence of that, our documentation is constantly under development and probably in need of some TLC. Right now, we have two team members that are maintaining the docs, and frankly, they could use a little help...

That's where YOU come in.

Our documentation repo is public and open-sourced [right here](https://github.com/8base/documentation) on GitHub. So whenever you want to, you could:

* Report missing sections: Think something **should** be in the documentation that **isn't**? [Create an issue](https://github.com/8base/documentation/issues) to let us know!
* Submit pull requests: Want to not only point out the problem but be apart of the solution? Clone down the Documentation and submit pull requests start... pretty much anything, like:
	* Grammar and spelling
	* Errors in any code example
	* Even BETTER code examples
	* Missing sections
	* Better descriptions
	* A nice GIF of a police man in the Authorization section
	* Anything else...

If you need help getting started, just reach out to us at [support@8base.com](mailto:support@8base.com). However, here are some more complete descriptions of work that can be done.

### 1. Reporting an Issue
8base uses GitHub Issue Tracking to track issues (primarily bugs and contributions of new code). If you've found a bug in 8base, this is the place to start. You'll need to create a (free) GitHub account in order to submit an issue, to comment on them or to create pull requests.

### 2. Create an Awesome Code Example
Examples are sooo important in great documentation and are very helpful for the 8base community. You can help by providing complete code examples, or by editing the current ones. Honestly, if you think "a, b, and c examples are terrible and I could make them better", please do! We won't take it personally...

### 3. Contributing Articles
You can help improve the 8base Docs by making them more coherent, consistent, or readable and adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing typos, and bringing them up to date with the latest 8base features. It's honestly an open-book. If you think something is useful, others probably will too.

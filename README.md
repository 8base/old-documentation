## Contributing

Like most great things, 8base is a work in progress. As a consequence of that, our documentation is constantly under development and probably in need of some TLC. Right now, we have two team members are maintaining the docs and, frankly, they could use a little help...

That's where YOU come in. Our documentation repo is public and hosted [right here](https://github.com/8base/documentation) on GitHub. So whenever you want to, you could:

* Report missing sections: Think something **should** be in the documentation that **isn't**? [Create an issue](https://github.com/8base/documentation/issues) to let us know!
* Submit pull requests: Want to not only point out the problem but be apart of the solution? Clone down the Documentation and submit pull requests start... pretty much anything, like:
	* Grammar and spelling
	* Errors in any code example
	* Even BETTER code examples
	* Missing sections
	* Better descriptions
	* A nice GIF of a police man in the Authorization section
	* Anything else...

If you need help getting started, just reach out to us at [support@8base.com](mailto:support@8base.com).

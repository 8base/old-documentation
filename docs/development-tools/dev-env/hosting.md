# Front-end Hosting

8base does not have a solution for hosting front-end applications. Depending on the type of application you're building, we'd recommend looking at one of the following services. Being that your workspace's API endpoint is fully accessible over the web, it doesn't matter which hosting provider you use.

### Amazon S3 

You can use Amazon S3 to host a static website. On a static website, individual webpages include static content. They might also contain client-side scripts.

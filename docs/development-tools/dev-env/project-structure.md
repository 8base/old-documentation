# Project Structure
When using the [8base CLI](/docs/development-tools/cli) to create a new project with all default options, it will create a directory structure that resembles the following:

```text
Building a new project called ExampleProject ðŸš€

ExampleProject
â”œâ”€â”€ .workspace.json
â”œâ”€â”€ 8base.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ resolvers
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ resolver
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ handler.ts
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ mocks

    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ handler.ts
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ mocks
    â”‚           â””â”€â”€ request.json
    â””â”€â”€ webhooks
        â””â”€â”€ webhook
            â”œâ”€â”€ handler.ts

                â””â”€â”€ request.json

All the dependencies can be installed using `npm` or `yarn`. Additionally, the 8base CLI comes with Webpack and TypeScript pre-configured. This allows you to write code in JavaScript or TypeScript in your custom functions, as well as use `async/await`.

Following this project structure is valuable for staying organized and getting the most out of 8base's CLI. For example, the CLI's [generator commands](/docs/development-tools/cli/generators) offer great convenience for scaffolding new resources and will add generated files using pattern seen above (`src/<functionType>/<functionName>/**/*`).

## Server vs. Client
It's very common that developers wish to commit their server-side and client-side code to the same git repository. In such situations, we suggest cleanly seperating the two directories at the project's root level. This will prevent a number of errors that would otherwise occure when installing dependencies and deploying code.

Try using the following directory structure when committing server-side and client-side code to the same git repository:

```text
ExampleProject
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ client/
â””â”€â”€ server/
```

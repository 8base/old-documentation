Each workspace has a GraphQL API endpoint with queries, mutations and subscriptions for every table representing CRUD \(create/read/update/delete\) operations. The API comes with filtering, pagination, full-text search and other features to make the job of front-end developers easier.

You can get your workspace API endpoint URL in Data Builder. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/703d70b-endpoint.png](https://files.readme.io/703d70b-endpoint.png)", "endpoint.png", 823, 591, "\#9c9d9e" \], "caption": "Click \"Endpoint\" to get API URL" } \] } \[/block\]

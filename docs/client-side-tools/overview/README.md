# Client Tools

8base provides a set of client libraries that simplify building front-end applications on top of 8base platform:

* [**SDK**](https://github.com/8base/sdk) comes with a set of libraries that simplify authentication, connecting to the API, client-side subscriptions, file uploads and more. SDK uses [ApolloClient](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) for GraphQL requests and state management. It uses [Auth0](https://auth0.com/Auth0) for authentication.
* [**Boost UI Kit**](https://github.com/8base/boost) provides a set of common UI components, such as form fields, tables, layout elements and a file upload widget. Some of the components are pre-wired with the 8base API to enable automatic client-side validation and other features.
* [**Example App**](https://github.com/8base/app-example) can be used as a starter project to quickly learn how to build on 8base. Read our [Quickstart guide](https://docs.8base.com/v1.0/docs/quickstart) for more details.

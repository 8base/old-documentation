# What's the 8base Management Console?
The 8base Management Console is where you manage all backend resources, like Data Models, Roles and Permissions, Users, API Tokens, and more. It's a secure, easy-to-access and beautifully designed web portal that can be accessed from any computer, allowing teams to collaborate and build all types of applications.

To get started quickly with the 8base Management Console, all you'll need is [an 8base account](https://app.8base.com) and a modern web browser.

# Subscriptions

Subscriptions let your client-side application receive server-side events from the 8base platform. This is useful when you are building real-time functionality such as chats or notifications. Subscriptions are automatically generated for every data table you create.

Apollo Client provides a standard way to use subscriptions, but some additional configuration needs to be implemented in order to connect to the Websocket endpoint. However, if you are using [EightBaseAppProvider](https://github.com/8base/sdk/tree/master/packages/app-provider) from 8base open-source SDK it does all the configuration for you and you can start using subscriptions out of the box. \[block:code\] { "codes": \[ { "code": "import gql from 'graphql-tag';\nimport { Subscription } from 'react-apollo';\n\nconst CHAT\_MESSAGE\_SUBSCRIPTION = gql`\n subscription onChatMessageAdded($chatId: String!) {\n ChatMessage(filter: {\n mutation_in: [create],\n node: {\n chatId: {\n equals: $chatId\n }\n }\n }) {\n node {\n createdAt\n createdBy {\n firstName\n lastName\n }\n text\n }\n }\n }\n`;\n\nconst NewChatMessage = \({ chatId }\) =&gt; \(\n \n {\({ data: { ChatMessage }, loading }\) =&gt; \(\n New message: {!loading && ChatMessage.text}\n \)}\n\n\);", "language": "javascript", "name": "SubscriptionExample.js" } \] } \[/block\]

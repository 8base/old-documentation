# Quick Start
The goal of this quickstart is to get you up and running with 8base and a front-end framework you love, fast.

Let's do it!

This guide will introduce some basics of 8base workspaces and set up a starter app. It will help demonstrate key concepts of 8base, and maybe even kick-off your next awesome project üòä

## 1. Start an 8base Account
If you haven't already, create an 8base account. Click [this link](https://app.8base.com) to get started. We'll send you a confirmation email if you use an email and password to create your account. Either way, once your account is confirmed 8base will redirect you to a default workspace.

Voila! You've officially on 8base.

## 2. Setting up a Workspace
Each workspace is treated as an individual project ‚Äì like having different Git repositories for different code bases. This makes it easy to stay organized with projects and upgrade individual workspaces when your app or service starts to scale! 

Each workspace starts on a [30-day Free Trial](https://www.8base.com/pricing). Let's just use the default workspace for the rest of this quick-start.

_Optional: If you want to create a new workspace, click the "YOUR NAME's Workspace" dropdown at the top of your screen and select "+ New Workspace". Name it whatever you like before pressing create. The new workspace should load in less then 10-seconds._

### 2.1. Building a Data Model
In the workspace, navigate to the [Data Builder](https://app.8base.com/data/) page and click on ‚Äú+Add Table‚Äù. Were going to create one simple table for our data model with the following fields.

**Notes**
| Field | Type | Description | Options |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `title`  | Text | The notes title | `mandatory=True` |
| `body`  | Text | The notes body | `mandatory=True` |

Once the tables is created, we're going to establish a relationship between it and the *Users* table. This can be done by dragging one table onto the other. However, we'll build the one-to-many relationship manually on the *Notes* table.

**Add user to Notes**
| Field | Type | Description | Options |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `user` | Table | A notes other | `table=Users`<br>`Relation Field Name=notes`<br>`Allow multiple Notes per User=True`<br>`Allow multiple Users per Note=False` |

Before moving on, lets also add several dummy records to our database. You can do this manually by navigating to the `data` tab. However, lets just run the following GraphQL mutation in the [API Explorer](https://app.8base.com/api-explorer).

```javascript
mutation {
  userUpdate(
  filter: {
    email: "<YOUR_ACCOUNT_EMAIL_ADDRESS>"
  },
  data: {
    notes: {
      create: [
        {
          title: "New favorite food",
          body: "My new favorite food is the impossible burger"
        },
        {
          title: "This weeks todos",
          body: "Buy milk, cookies, and walk the dog."
        }
      ]
    }
  }) {
    notes {
      count
    }
  }
}
```

GraphQL mutations (like the one above) handle record creates, updates, and deletes. The `data.notes.create` value will actually create notes associated with the user record we're identifying by email ‚Äì which is **you** in this example. The reason the value is an array is because *Users* can have many *Notes*.

- *[API Explorer docs](https://docs.8base.com/8base-console/platform-tools/api-explorer)*

### 2.2. Roles and Permissions
We only want to users to see their own notes. A custom role can enforce this. Navigate to `Settings` > `Roles` and create new role with the name "Reviewer". Once created, click the role and lets update its permissions. 

Let's check the appropriate boxes and select the needed options.

**Reviewer**
| Table | Create | Read | Update | Delete | Fields |
| ----- | ------ | ---- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Notes | True | User's Records | User's Records | True | *Defaults |

Now, all users with the *Reviewer* role who call the workspace API endpoint can permform these actions.

- *[Roles and Permissions docs](https://docs.8base.com/8base-console/roles-and-permissions)*

### 2.3. Authentication Profiles
Setting up authentication will allow users to sign-up, log-in, and log-out of the app. For this quickstart, users should be authenticated to view their list of notes.

Navigate to the [*Authentication page*](https://app.8base.com/settings/authentication) in settings. To create a new authentication profile, click the plus-sign button and specify the following values. 

| Option | Value | Notes |
| ------ | ----- | ----- |
| `Name` | "Default Guest Auth" | Choose any descriptive name |
| `Type` | 8base authentication | Find more auth info in the [docs](https://docs.8base.com/8base-console/authentication#8base-authentication) |
| `Self Signup` | Open to all | Leave `Off` if using a free workspace |
| `Roles` | Reviewer | Multiple roles can be assigned to user on sign up |

Add the new authentication profile. The information that‚Äôs now displayed will be used when adding authentication to the frontend. Note the Authentication Profile `Id`, the `Client ID` and the `Domain` ‚Äì these values will come in handy later in the article.

Scroll down to where you see `Custom Domains`. This is where you can provide routes that‚Äôll be used during authentication. Make sure the `localhost:port` number matches that which your app will run on in development!

- *[Authentication Profile docs](https://docs.8base.com/8base-console/authentication#8base-authentication)*

### 2.4. Getting the Workspace API Endpoint
Lastly, let‚Äôs copy our workspace‚Äôs API endpoint. This endpoint is unique to our workspace and is to where we will send our data requests using GraphQL. 

There are a few ways to obtain the endpoint. However, just navigate to the workspace **Home** page and you‚Äôll find the endpoint in the bottom left.‚Ää

## 3. Setting up the Client
An important concept to grasp is that 8base is a Backend-as-a-Service that any frontend application can connect to using the workspace API. This creates a very clear separation between the server-side (8base) and client-side (app / frontend). 

```
# Project Directory Tree

8base-starter-app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ server/
```

Lets create a new directory with this separation in mind by adding setting up the printed `Project Directory Tree` structure. This can be accomplished with the following two shell commands.

```
# Make directory with client/ and server/ directory at root
mkdir 8base-starter-app 8base-starter-app/client 8base-starter-app/server

# Move into project and add README.md
cd 8base-starter-app && touch README.md
```
### 3.1. Install the 8base CLI and Authenticate
To harness the full power of 8base, you'll want to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer. Without it, you won't be able to install our handy [8base CLI](https://github.com/8base/cli).

Assuming you're all set up and able to use `npm`, let's go ahead and install the 8base CLI.

```text
# Install 8base globally
npm install -g 8base-cli
```

When using the 8base CLI you need to authenticate your development workspace. This allows you to communicate with 8base for deploys, function invocations, logs, and more. Try running the `login` command and allow your browser to launch a new window (you may have to login).

```text
# Login with CLI.
8base login
```

### 3.2 Deploy a Serverless Function (OPTIONAL)
This step is **totally optional** in the quickstart and will show you how to quickly extend your workspace by generating and deploying serverless functions to a workspace. 

Move into the `8base-starter-app/server` directory. Let's initialize a new server project and configure to a hosted workspace. Using the `init` and `configure` commands will generate and configure the needed resources. The workspace you select is the one where the Functions will be deployed to when ready.

```text
# Change into the server directory
cd ../server

# Init new 8base project with one function called myCustomResolver
8base init . --functions=resolver:myCustomResolver

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure the project's workspace
8base configure

‚úî Select workspace for current project ‚Ä∫ Default Workspace
```

Once configured, a `.workspace.json` file gets added to the directory which conatains the selected workspace's ID. More indepth documentation can be found on Custom Functions [here](https://docs.8base.com/8base-console/custom-functions). However, feel free to poke around the files marked with an astrix(*) below before deploying the dummy function.

```sh
server
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .workspace.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *8base.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ resolvers
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myCustomResolver
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *handler.ts
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mocks
            ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *request.json
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *schema.graphql
```

By running the `8base deploy` command, we deploy the Function to our workspace (AWS Lambda in the background). Being a `resolver` function, we've now added the `myCustomResolver` operation to our GraphQL API. A pretty cool!

There are many custom function types you can deploy on 8base, all of which must be configured in the `8base.yml` file located at the root of your project.

{% hint style="info" %}
Serverless custom functions provide tremendous flexibility in customizing server-side resources and allowing advanced capabilities, like: 

* Resolvers: For adding custom *Querys* and *Mutations* to the GraphQL API.
* Triggers: For invoking functions on data events (before|after record create|update|delete, run function)
* Webhooks: For invoking functions on webhook events using HTTP requests ([GET|POST|PUT|DELETE] @ endpoint)
* Scheduled Tasks: For invoking functions on timed intervals (once a day, every five-minutes, or cron format)
{% endhint %}

### 3.3. Choose a Starter App / Framework for the Frontend
8base gives you full freedom to use whatever front-end technologies/frameworks you'd like! For this quickstart, we recommend that you use one of our starter apps. Currently, they are:

| Framework | Repo | Clone |
| ------    | -----   | ------- |
| Vue | [Repo](https://github.com/8base/vue-8base-starter-app) | `git clone https://github.com/8base/vue-8base-starter-app.git`|
| React | [Repo](https://github.com/8base/react-8base-starter-app) | `git clone https://github.com/8base/react-8base-starter-app.git` |

Depending on the framework you wish to use, try cloning it into the `8base-starter-app/client/` directory. The following commands have been listed for each framework-specific starter app.

```
# Move into the client directory and
cd ../client

# Clone Starter App
git clone <CloneUrl> .

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

After cloning the project, make sure to change into the `8base-starter-app/client` directory and run `npm install` (or `yarn`) so that all the required packages get installed.

### 3.4. Setting up the client
All of the starter apps are preconfigured for both authentication and API communication. All they need are a few workspace specific strings to be set as environment variables. Look for a `8base-starter-app/client/.env` file that contains a template for the required environment variables. Fill in the template with all appropriate values (each starter app has a READme.md with instructions).

## 4. Run the app!
Using the command appropriate to the chosen starter app (`npm start/serve/etc.`) and boot it up! You can now login, logout, and sign-up to in starter app using your username and password. Meanwhile, when authenticated you're able to access the Profile page, which queries the GraphQL API for the authenticated user information.

## 5. Challenge
Who ever said life has to be easy? The whole goal of this quickstart is to learn, and you can't learn if you don't try! So, here is a challenge for you.

Go back to the [API Explorer](https://app.8base.com/api-explorer) and click on the `Explorer` button. Once opened, find the `notesList` operation and build a query. Once that query is built, run it to make sure it's working properly.

Now copy the working query and add it to your application. Go ahead! Regardless of the framework you've selected, there are plenty of tips and hints in the READMEs for you to get rocking-and-rolling.

## Conclusion
We hope this guide helped you better understand how 8base works. Feel free to keep experimenting with your workspace, add new tables, deploy custom logic, and develop amazing applications!
